# About

This is a simple tutorial that walks you through the creation of a simple decentralized application. It contains everything you need to know to build and test this application and assumes no prior experience with DApp/blockchain development of any kind. If you want a broad overview before diving into it, we recommend reading the overview first. On the other hand, if this is too simple, then you may want to start the workshop for larger and less constrained projects or the reference manual for the minute details of Reach
## Installation

You need to have **make** installed. For example, OS X and many other POSIX systems come with **make**, but some versions of Linux do not include it by default and will require you to install it. If you're on Ubuntu, you can run ```sudo apt install make``` to get it.
